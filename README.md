Review: Above article is a simple and light but strongly helps to understand why one should study DSA or know about it.
After reading I did feel the importance of learning DSA. After reading this article I feel I have more close/deep understanding of
js.

Review: MDN is the best website to learn the javascript from. One might not get the hang of this site immediately but once you have a bit
understanding of javascript and wants to learn something with more tech specific than this site helps like anything. Also you get all the
lastest update in javascript and web updates on this site, so do follow it :p. I also like there "See Also" section which link to other
article.
